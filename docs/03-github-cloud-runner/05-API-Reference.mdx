```

Commands called during cloud runner workflows before/after a build.

## Main Parameters

### Git syncronization parameters

```md
gitPrivateToken (should be a GitHub access token with permission to get repositories)
```

Used to authenticate remote job's access to repository.

```md
- GITHUB_REPOSITORY
- GITHUB_REF || branch || GitSHA
```

Used to syncronize the repository to the Cloud Runner job. If parameters are not provided, will
attempt to read them from current directory's git repo (e.g branch, commit SHA, remote URL).

```

Specifies the CPU and Memory resources to be used for cloud containers created by Cloud Runner.
(See: getting started section for more configuration options per provider.)

```md
cloudRunnerBranch
```

Specifies the release branch of Cloud Runner to use for remote containers. Accepted values: `main`
(default), `cloud-runner-preview` (stable/development), `cloud-runner-develop` (latest/development)

### Custom commands from files parameters

```md
- customStepFiles
- customHookFiles
```

Specifies the name of custom hook or step files to include in workflow. (Accepted Format: see
`advanced topics / custom steps + hooks`)

### Custom commands from yaml parameters

```md
customJob
```

Specifies a custom job to override default build workflow. (Accepted Format: see
`advanced topics / custom job`)

```md
- customJobHooks
- postBuildSteps
- preBuildSteps
```

Specify yaml based hooks or pre/post build steps.

(Accepted Format: see `advanced topics / custom steps + hooks`)

### Configuration Override

```md
readInputOverrideCommand
```

Read parameter from command line ouput, such as a secret manager. Must include a `{0}` to inject the
name of the parameter to pull.

```md
readInputFromOverrideList
```

List of parameters to apply with `readInputOverrideCommand`.

### Aws

```md
awsBaseStackName
```

Name of the persistent shared base stack, used to store artifacts and caching.

### K8s

```md
- kubeVolume
- kubeVolumeSize
- kubeStorageClass
```

Override name of persistent volume used, size of volume and storage class used.

### Caching

```md
cacheKey
```

Defaults to branch name. Defines the scope for sharing cache entries.

### Utility

```md
- cloudRunnerTests || cloudRunnerDebug (Debug logging for Cloud Runner)
- cloudRunnerDebugTree (Logs cloud container file tree)
- cloudRunnerDebugEnv (Logs cloud container envrionment details)
- watchToEnd (do not follow build)
- useSharedLargePackages (Any packages in manifest.json containing phrase "LargePackage" will be
  redirected to a shared folder for all builds sharing a cache key)
- useSharedBuilder (Use a shared clone of Game-CI, saves some storage space and can be used if
  you're using one release branch of Cloud Runner)
- useLz4Compression (Use Lz4 compression for cache and build artifacts. Enabled by default)
```

### Retained Workspace

```md
- retainWorkspaces
- maxRetainedWorkspaces
```

See "Advanced Topics / Retained Workspaces", enables caching entire project folder.

### Garbage Collection

```md
- constantGarbageCollection
- garbageCollectionMaxAge
```

## Command Line Only Parameters
