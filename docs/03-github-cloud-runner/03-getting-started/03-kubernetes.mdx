# GitHub Actions - Kubernetes

## Requirements

- You must have a Kuberentes cluster setup and ready that supports persistent volumes.
- Create a kubeconfig and encode it as base64.

## K8s Credentials

Setup the following as `env` variables for the GitHub build step:

- `kubeConfig` (should be encoded as base64)

## Configuration For Kubernetes Cloud Runner Jobs

Refer to [Configuration page](../api-reference) or the [example below](#example).

### Allowed CPU/Memory Combinations

- `0.25 vCPU` - 0.5 GB, 1 GB, 2 GB
- `0.5 vCPU` - 1 GB, 2 GB, 3 GB, 4 GB
- `1 vCPU` - 2 GB, 3 GB, 4 GB, 5 GB, 6 GB, 7 GB, 8 GB
- `2 vCPU` - Between 4 GB and 16 GB in 1-GB increments
- `4 vCPU` - Between 8 GB and 30 GB in 1-GB increments

Do not include the vCPU or GB suffix.

#### Valid CPU and Memory Values

```yaml
- remoteBuildMemory: 2
- remoteBuildCpu: 0.5
```

### Example

```yaml
- uses: game-ci/unity-builder@cloud-runner-develop
  id: k8s-unity-build
  timeout-minutes: 30
  with:
    cloudRunnerCluster: k8s
    UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
    targetPlatform: ${{ matrix.targetPlatform }}
    kubeConfig: ${{ steps.read-base64.outputs.base64 }}
    gitPrivateToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    projectPath: test-project
    unityVersion: ${{ matrix.unityVersion }}
    versioning: None
    # Currently kuberentes builds do not save their persistent volumes beyond a cloud runner job.
    # So, you may want to export the results to cloud storage with a postBuildStep as follows:
    customStepFiles: aws-s3-upload-build
```
